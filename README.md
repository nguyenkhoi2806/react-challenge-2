# Breaking Bad Challenge

- Over the past weekend, the graphic artist for AMC was tragically killed while participating in a high-stakes Yahtzee tournament.
- Executive producer Vince Gilligan has reached out to you and asked you to help style their logo for an upcoming episode.

# The problem:

- Given an Array containing a fake periodic table of elements, write a function below that will take an Array of strings,
- find where the periodic elements are in the string, and if a match is found, wrap the matching characters in a `<span>`
- tag so that it will be styled correctly on the page.
- The function should return an Array of strings with the matching elements wrapped in a `<span>` tag.
- Once you have written the code, pass the result of the function to the `display` method, so it can be displayed.
